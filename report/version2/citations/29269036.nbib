AB  - AIM: To identify the extent to which transfer learning from deep convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs), pre-trained on non-medical images, can be used for 
      automated fracture detection on plain radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The top 
      layer of the Inception v3 network was re-trained using lateral wrist radiographs 
      to produce a model for the classification of new studies as either "fracture" or 
      "no fracture". The model was trained on a total of 11,112 images, after an 
      eightfold data augmentation technique, from an initial set of 1,389 radiographs 
      (695 "fracture" and 694 "no fracture"). The training data set was split 80:10:10 
      into training, validation, and test groups, respectively. An additional 100 wrist 
      radiographs, comprising 50 "fracture" and 50 "no fracture" images, were used for 
      final testing and statistical analysis. RESULTS: The area under the receiver 
      operator characteristic curve (AUC) for this test was 0.954. Setting the 
      diagnostic cut-off at a threshold designed to maximise both sensitivity and 
      specificity resulted in values of 0.9 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSION: The AUC 
      scores for this test were comparable to state-of-the-art providing proof of 
      concept for transfer learning from CNNs in fracture detection on plain 
      radiographs. This was achieved using only a moderate sample size. This technique 
      is largely transferable, and therefore, has many potential applications in 
      medical imaging, which may lead to significant improvements in workflow 
      productivity and in clinical risk reduction.
