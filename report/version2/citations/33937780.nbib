AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of an object detection 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) for fracture detection and localization on 
      wrist radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was 
      obtained with waiver of consent for this retrospective study. A total of 7356 
      wrist radiographic studies were extracted from a hospital picture archiving and 
      communication system. Radiologists annotated all radius and ulna fractures with 
      bounding boxes. The dataset was split into training (90%) and validation (10%) 
      sets and used to train fracture localization models for frontal and lateral 
      images. Inception-ResNet Faster R-CNN architecture was implemented as a deep 
      learning model. The models were tested on an unseen test set of 524 consecutive 
      emergency department wrist radiographic studies with two radiologists in 
      consensus as the reference standard. Per-fracture, per-image (ie, per-view), and 
      per-study sensitivity and specificity were determined. Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was performed. RESULTS: The model 
      detected and correctly localized 310 (91.2%) of 340 and 236 (96.3%) of 245 of all 
      radius and ulna fractures on the frontal and lateral views, respectively. The 
      per-image sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 95.7% (95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 92.4%, 97.8%), 82.5% (95% CI: 77.4%, 86.8%), and 0.918 (95% CI: 0.894, 
      0.941), respectively, for the frontal view and 96.7% (95% CI: 93.6%, 98.6%), 
      86.4% (95% CI: 81.9%, 90.2%), and 0.933 (95% CI: 0.912, 0.954), respectively, for 
      the lateral view. The per-study sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 98.1% (95% 
      CI: 95.6%, 99.4%), 72.9% (95% CI: 67.1%, 78.2%), and 0.895 (95% CI: 0.870, 
      0.920), respectively. CONCLUSION: The ability of an object detection CNN to 
      detect and localize radius and ulna fractures on wrist radiographs with high 
      sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated.Â© RSNA, 2019.
