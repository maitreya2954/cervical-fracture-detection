AB  - There is controversy regarding the optimal imaging strategy in adult blunt trauma 
      patients for suspected cervical spine trauma. Some investigators recommend 
      negative computed tomography (CT) alone to clear the cervical spine in adult 
      blunt trauma patients, while others insist that MR imaging is necessary, 
      especially among obtunded adult blunt trauma patients. CT is an excellent imaging 
      modality for bony cervical spine injury; however, there is a nonzero rate of 
      clinically significant cervical spine injuries missed on CT. MR imaging has high 
      sensitivity for soft tissue cervical spine injuries, but low specificity for the 
      rare isolated unstable ligamentous cervical spine injury.
